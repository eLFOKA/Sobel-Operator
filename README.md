# Sobel-Operator

<h2> Program purpose </h2>
It's simple, the program was made for my University. Time passed and i realized that this code has potencial to bring smile on some faces, when they see their images converted by it. 

<h2> What program does </h2>
This program give to the user chance of playing with their images by exaggerating all edges. It looks cool and whole process takes a few seconds. 

Here some examples

<h2>How to use it</h2>
<div>
Please remember that the current version is alpha, so using it makes seem a little difficult, but i hope that instruction bellow will clarify everything at this moment   
</div>
<div>
<ol>
  <li>Download all files</li>
  <li>Convert your image type from .png/.jpeg/.jpg to 24-bit map (.bmp)<p>I strongly suggest using for it Paint. You ask why? Because for now it is only known     for me option that works. I tried other converters on the internet but it seems that they do not work properly with the current version of the program. Simple Open     image in Paint and save it as 24-bit bitmap</p></li>
  <li>Take your converted bitmap and put it in "Sobel Operator" Folder (the folder also contains .cpp file)</li>
  <li>Run Program by opening the "x64" folder, then "Debug" and click on "Sobel Operator.exe"</li>
  <li>Console window will pop up with instructions for you on what to do next</li>
  <li>After successful operation of the program, your converted image will appear in the same file where you put the original bitmap</li>
  <li>Enjoy your converted bitmap!</li>
</ol>

  <h2>The future of the program</h2>
  <p>For now, the program is very raw, and far from working smoothly. Over time I would like to change it and maybe release it as a working tool, for who? I don't know, will figure it out later. Plans are that in some time the program will be capable of finding edges in short videos. If you like my work and it truly brought a smile to your face to you let me know!</p>
  <p>Have a great time,
